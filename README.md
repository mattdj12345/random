### Look into SPF and DMARC
Protection againt spoofed emails
From Google:
What is an SPF record in DNS? An SPF record is a type of Domain Name Service (DNS) record that identifies which mail servers are permitted to send email on behalf of your domain. The purpose of an SPF record is to prevent spammers from sending messages with forged From addresses at your domain.

### Thoughts
What is the intention with the end results; will I run all my email through here ?
